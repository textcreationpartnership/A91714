            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving peruſed a paper in forme of an Epiſtle, ſubſcribed a Letter written by <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>William Pryn</hi> Eſquire, wherein you take occaſion in your <hi>Exordium,</hi> to intimate that honour God vouchſafed you to be a witneſſe to the Truth with Maſter <hi>Pryn,</hi> under the reign of Epiſcopall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. [Yet there is a vaſt difference between the grounds of ſuffering on the one ſide, and on the other: <hi>Paul</hi> tels us of ſuffering as buſie bodies [God grant this charge fall not upon you.] And indeed it is not ſo much the ſuffering, as the ſuffering like a Chriſtian, that is acceptable with God, or eſteemed worthy of honour before men] from whence you draw an Argument to prove an affection in people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, to the miſleading of their judgements, cauſing them to build with too much confidence, on what ſhall be ſpoken or written by you, without due examination; never eying or conſidering what is ſaid, ſo much as the perſons ſpeaking: who they be, you give me not to underſtand, except in Generall [your conſtant practice in caſes ſubject to doubts] as if your charge did reach to all, and not unto particulars, the latter of which I conceive comes neareſt Truth; It being the weakneſſe of ſome not able to judge and determine of theſe things, or the wilfulneſſe of others that have judgement, yet willingly permit the miſts and fogs of darkneſſe to over-cloud it: when as the more learned and inſtructed receive things not upon bare affirmation [a mighty pillar for uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your foundation] but with judgement, what they find is moſt agreeable to Truth in their underſtandings, ſetting by what upon ſearch [not upon phanſie] they find not conſonant to the Word, and this is done, without any prejudice to, or pre-judging of the abilities of thoſe that excell them. How ever you are pleaſed to conceive of others in this particular, I heartily wiſh you were not, or would not be ignorant of one thing.</p>
            <p>To conſider how much of this ſpirit rules in thoſe that are contrary minded to Maſter <hi>Pryn,</hi> or any adhering to him in judgement; and if I miſtake not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112937:4"/>[preſumption laid aſide] your ſelf is not a little guilty in this charge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond particular I find in order to be ſpoken of, is, Maſter <hi>Pryns</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and unſavoury language (as you ſay) againſt the Saints of God, and the unſpotted wayes of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To this I reply, That what bitterneſſe, &amp;c. you may meet with (exceeding your own) was not (I dare affirme) againſt the Saints of God truly ſo, walking in the unſpotted wayes of Jeſus Chriſt [neither can be collected from any thing by him written] But againſt thoſe phanſies and ſtrange Enthuſiaſmes, which thoſe that call themſelves Saints by way of priviledge and prerogative, [which yet I ſee them not to be] and under that notion take a liberty to vent and broach Doctrines and concluſions contrary to faith and good manners, tending directly to Anarchy and confuſion, againſt theſe his zeale was powred forth, as it were, without meaſure, that he might oppoſe theſe tenents and doctrines of novelties which creep in upon us daily by ſucceſſion: And that ſuch a ſpirit is not altogether without preſident. Obſerve the temper of <hi>Paul</hi> againſt him who would have perverted the Truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.10, 11. Not that from hence I would go about to juſtifie what fleſh and blood may ſometimes do through frailty, but to let you ſee in ſome caſes it is lawfull to ſpeak with Authority: And if you will but cleare your eyes and look on things and perſons impartially, you ſhall behold [as formerly you might] leading preſidents from men of your own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, before Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> did undertake to engage himſelf in this controverſie, at which willing and wilfull ignorance I ſtand amazed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing that comes next to hand, is M. <hi>Pryn's</hi> great confidence, weak and unſound Arguments [thus you.]</p>
            <p>To which I ſay, that whereas you would make void and of no effect, thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid aſſertions of M. <hi>Pryn's,</hi> which are eſteemed at ſo low a rate in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till I find that you or any of yee produce others of more weighty conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you ſhall give me leave to ſpare my weapons in this encounter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Complaint making it's way, is, the robbing you of your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the publique uſe of the Preſſe.</p>
            <p>This I judge an act of wiſdome, and not of bondage [as you inſinuate] For might every one ſpeak in publique what the madneſſe of his brain and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded phanſie leads him to, there would be no end of ſtrife, but a world of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, who would not plead conſcience if that might protect them, yea, even for the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112937:4"/>all for the good of the Parliament: How I ſhall be aſſured of all this, or any man elſe, my ſoule enters not into this your ſecret, but gladly would find ſome ſatisfaction, that I may be able to beare witneſſe to the truth of this now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Let me expoſtulate the caſe a little with you: What have yee done more than yee ſhou'd, nay then in conſcience yee ought to do, wherein have you, or any of yee excelled others, that none can reach up to the height of thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings yee lye under, ſhew it me; Are there not thouſands that are equall with yee in this lot, and as many that excell yee, whoſe ſilence ſpeaks them praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: worthy: men that for religion are but babes in Chriſtianity, in reſpect of what yee ſeem to have aſcended to; Is this for the honour of Chriſt whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be your Lord and Maſter, thus to complain, and beſpeak the compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men from an argument of miſery felt or feared, as the five Independant Members have done before you: Have you thus learned Chriſt? What though yee have caſt all into the banck, muſt yee receive it preſently with uſury, or yee are undone; have yee not the ſame God, the ſame cauſe to manage as at firſt; Why grow yee weary in well doing; dare yee not truſt God with his own, or with what yee charge upon him as his? Which yee are ſo confident of, for the rightneſſe and onlineſſe of the way, and have extolled even to the heavens for the juſtneſſe of it: Verily this preſages a large meaſure of ſelfiſhneſſe in all your actions, that ſelf ſtands ſo long upon the ſtage in ſo few lines, to juſtifie its maſters integrity: And for your more than a third part of this Epiſtle, that fals ſo heavy upon the Tribe of <hi>Levy,</hi> wherein have yee received prejudice by them, or heard words from them, are they not (rather) become your enemies, becauſe they ſpeak the Truth. If the Truth have ſuffered through their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, it will ſpeak its own priviledge in Goſpell language, and not in bitter invectives beſide reaſon: Doubtleſſe, arguments with wiſe men are the way to conquer, but with ſimple ones the language of fooles; had you charge againſt them, proceeded from judgement, your paper had not been ſo empty of accuſations, nor ſo froughted with froth and vanity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth Accuſation fals heavy on the Synod, whom you compare for tyranny, to the Spaniſh Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>Here your bare affirmation muſt ſtand up in the place of Arguments [an eaſie confutation] <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> muſt ſuffice for the ſubjecting my faith to this or the other mans phanſie: when by cleare demonſtrations you ſhall reſolve my judgement in this particular, I ſhall anſwer as becomes Chriſtianity, till then my determination is that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 27.22.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh particular is matter of Complaint on your part, for being reckoned amongſt the number of State and Church moleſters.</p>
            <p>I conceive this charge ſtands upon a ſure foundation; if diſobedience to the lawfull power of civill Magiſtrates, and thoſe Ordinances by them enjoyned, to be obſerved for a regular proceeding in matters Eccleſiaſticall, as well as Civill, [having the advice of godly and learned Divines] ſo far as they are not diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from the Word, and reſts not in their power of neceſſity to command and preſſe the performance of, if they will diſcharge the precepts of God. In this caſe yee are both Church and State diſturbers, which hath been excellently proved by Maſter <hi>Rutherford,</hi> Doctor <hi>Steuart,</hi> and of late by <hi>William Pryn,</hi> as yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112937:5"/>not anſwered; which charge againſt you, and men in your way, and of your ſpirit, hath not falne ſo heavily as deſervedly.</p>
            <p>Now to your Propoſitions, which come next to be toucht at (for I intend no large reply.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the firſt I anſwer, that your conteſtation will be nothing leſſe, than beating of the ayre, ſtrife about words, contention without a ground, becauſe I find not any one to have denied ought in that Poſition, whereupon you can ground a challenge of controverſie: This is but the firſt peele of the Onion, the ſecond will ſmell more ſtrongly. And for that,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I deſire your proofes and arguments, your Scriptures heaped up in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, engage themſelves, but not in your war; I deſire to be informed of your meaning, when you tell us of compleat and perfect Lawes: Where are they to be found; and what Kingdom of Chriſt it is you contend for, whether heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or earthly, ſpirituall or temporall? And what kind of Governing and ruling of Chriſt in this Kingdom, your ſoules ſo much long after? Your Scriptures ſpeak of a glorious kingdom which is on high, but condeſcend not in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to a temporall Monarchy of Chriſt on earth [the opinion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatized Jewes] which [ſeemes to me] you clearly hint at.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To third Propoſition, I anſwer by way of conceſſion, that Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ſpirituall, as it is in the hearts and ſoules of his Elect, but that it ſhould ſubſiſt on earth without relation to outward adminiſtration, I find not, nor can you contend for, without the diſanulling of your own principles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To your fourth, I judge not the ordinary power of Civill Magiſtrates to conſiſt in making lawes for the Church, it being peculiar to thoſe which are within the Church, and belonging to the Church, as Paſtors and Elders, &amp;c. (Secondly) the power of Magiſtracy is civill, the power of the Church is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: The civill Magiſtrate handleth Church matters, as they have relation to the body politique, in judging what is prejudiciall to the Common-weale; but the Church handle them as they may tend to edification: So that I ſay, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill power is above Church-men [ſimply ſo conſidered] as they ſtand members of a Chriſtian Common wealth. And the Church is above the Magiſtrate, as he is a member thereunto belonging, who is to be edified thereby, or cenſured in point of ſcandall: And look as the civill Magiſtrate hath no power intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Eccleſiaſticall over the Church or its members, which of its ſelf is ſupreme under Chriſts, the King thereof: In like manner, the Church hath no politique power above the Magiſtrates, who are ſupreame and accountable to none but God: That I be not miſconſtrued in his particular be pleaſed to take this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that my meaning is not as if they were no wayes accountable to the Parliament, the ſupreame Judicatory; neither doe I intend to make of no effect the publique Declamtions of Parliament actions to the whole Kingdome (which is neceſſary) for whom, and by whom they are entruſted with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power: But this, that they ſtand not bound in a particular way to give account to every particular perſon, but in the Generall: That is my meaning. And although the Church may be, and ſubſiſt without Magiſtracy, yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſefull to the Church, when Chriſtian, for the preſervation of the publique
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112937:5"/>Peace, in caſe of Schiſmes or diſſentions, by puniſhing the diſturbers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is not in the power of the Church to do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To the fifth and laſt, I am not of opinion that perſecution for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is an emblem of righteouſneſſe, and I think no man hath ever pleaded for ſuch a wickedneſſe, it any have, I profeſſe they are ſo far eſtranged from me, that I never ſaw or read any ſuch doctrine of devils: yet for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, I judge a diſtinction or two not unſeaſonable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to conſider of conſcience truly ſo, that is mſ led and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet willing to receive informati n and inſtruction, that it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Between a man full of opinions and conceits, miſ-led in judgement, pleading conſcience, and making it a refuge to ſhelter falſe hood, maskt over with the garment of Truth; which is ſo far from being reclaimed, that obſtinately he perſiſts and holds on in his imaginations to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of himſelfe, the ſtumbling [if not perpetuall falling] of many others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I muſt conſider of conſcience, as it looks upon truths, repreſented to it, to be errours, that ſuch a conſcience is none of Gods deputy, to which I am ſo far bound to yeeld obedience as abſolutely to reject truths as errors, becauſe I ſo judge: But as they come under the notion of errour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo eſteems them, it may be tollerable, where there is hearty ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to attaine better inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I am to look upon conſcience, as it relates to the action, or the manner of performing it; in the latter I confeſſe there may be, and often is a divine Majeſty awing the conſcience, that it dares not receive or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a neceſſary Truth, nor a lawfull action, by reaſon of a command that lyes upon the one, or the other, yet I am not to reject them, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinfull, but as inexpedient till theſe impediments be removed. And ſo I have done with your Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The eighth thing to be conſidered of, is your condemnation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Synods and Councels, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this my Anſwer is, That there is a lawfull and neceſſary uſe to be made of them, with out derogating from Scripture principles, in regard it oftentimes fals out, that in Church government we are to ſeek, in regard of the right ordering many circumſtances: As it was in the times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whom I never find to have attained to that compleatneſſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall government, [as is now purſued with ſo much eagerneſſe] but they did vary and change, according to the Churches paucity or plenitude [ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſubſtantials, which we have in as large a meaſure, if not larger than they had.] But for abſolute rules in all things, from which none might va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoſe purer times were not guilty of ſuch a thing, for ought I can find, much leſſe this degenerate and back ſliding age, into which we are falne: In this condition we now ſtand in, what courſe may better be taken (Scripture being ſilent) then to conſult with, and lay before us the practice of primitive Chriſtians and their ſucceſſours [whether in Synods or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, <hi>aui altier</hi>] to draw from them ſome light to help us out in what we are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112937:6"/>ignorant of, or may Hile in, through the want of light to guid us in the due Performance hereof, and ſo much the more, becauſe our contention de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon things that are to be beleeved as neceſſary to ſalvation, [a wonderfull miſtake amongſt ſeduced ſoules] but relates to ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in and about the worſhip of God, what is moſt convenient to be practiſed: And experience might let you ſee if not wilfully blinded, that thoſe dark times attained to more ſimplicity of godlineſſe, than this great light ſo much applauded for incompreheſibleneſſe did ever reach up to; Now I appeale to your own conſcience, whether there be not more reaſon to follow the ſteps of that little light which was but like the dawning of a day, who had eyes ſingly fixed upon the glory of their Creator, than run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new light, by many degrees worſe than darkneſſe [of which there is too, much in theſe dayes] which is by aſt with politique ends and ayms in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger meaſure than with Truth, and the Churches peace, which hath not been ſet before their eyes as the chiefe pearle of price, but maſtery. The neceſſity of Synods, &amp;c. is farther aſſerted from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. for the ending matters of ſtrife, which ariſe in the Church, too great for the deciſion of particular Congregations: There I find a Synod or Councell called by reaſon of an errour, ſpread abroad in the point of Circumciſion to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of many ſoules, as <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2. do demonſtrate. Now if it, had been, in the power of the Apoſtles to have ended this controverſie, acting by a ſpirit inſpired from on high, what means that conſultation of the Apoſtles and Elders, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. Unleſſe to give us to underſtand, that though they had a power as they were inſpired by God, yet they did not put forth that power, but referred it to publique diſputation with the Elders, as more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thontique, and as a way more effectuall to draw the Churches to yeeld ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to what ſhould be determined of, which you may ſee; came to paſſe afterwards, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. and if they had ſate in the capacity of Apoſtles, I demand what light the Elders could adde to them, that they by immediate inſpiration did not decide the controverſie, but to hold forth a patterne for after ages to look upon, and to be guided by, and to let us know, that though there be a power in particular congregations, <hi>in ſuo ordine,</hi> yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique determinations of a Synod of godly men, is the ſureſt way to end, ſtrife in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ninth charge flies in the face of Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who (you ſay) hath incited men to wage warre againſt the King of Saints, and his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones.</p>
            <p>My ſoule is at ſtrife within it ſelfe, to find out whom you mean by this King of Saints, and redeemed ones, whether it be all, or any one of the <hi>quinque eccleſian</hi> Miniſters, and the people belonging to there independant Churches, theſe redeemed ones: If this be your meaning [as I cannot imagine other wayes] againſt theſe [and yet not properly againſt theſe, but againſt, their tenents and notions] is Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> entred into battaile, to plead true Chriſtian lierties? part in behalfe of thoſe that are unjuſtly, charge as fighters againſt it: But if you intended it of Jeſus Chriſt, God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112937:6"/>and man, who truly is King of Saints, and no other, my ſoule longs for a manifeſtation of this warfare, that I may know (as well as you) when it was begun againſt Chriſt, and his redeemed ones, where and after what manner this warfare is carried on: And let me know by what means I may be aſſured theſe whom you ſtile redeemed ones are his, and none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them (for your words be are this conſtruction without ſtraying) I have looked into their lives, their converſations and beheld their outward commerce and trafficking in the world (for take them amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, and know them no more, nay, in a leſſer meaſure than <hi>Judas</hi> was known for a traitour while he remained with the twelve) and I cannot ſee how you can ſtampe this impreſſion upon them by way of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prerogative, before many of thoſe on whom your eye is ſixed with indignation: For love, faith, obedience, and ſelfe-deniall, wherein do they excell others, that their ſuperiours may not be brought to termes of equality with them, nay, wherein have many of them (if any of them) out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtript the very blindneſſe of, our progenitours, who will certainly riſe to judge and condemne this Generation of Profeſſours, for the neglect of, and the not conſcionably practiſing, according to that light they profeſſe themſelves poſſeſſed with, and to have exceeded all mon in: Surely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which overſhadows light is comprehended of the light, much more will light that is of genuine nature diſſipate (and annihilate the falſe riſing of fading vapours, that for a ſeaſon to outward view are glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The tenth charge againſt Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> runs thus: In that he hath ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, up the Potentates of the earth to pluck the Crowne of Chriſt of his head his Scepter out of his hand, and himſelf out of his Throne. Weightier accuſations, criminations, and criminations were never laid on any mans ſhoulders, then this you would make Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> to beare, where is your proofe for this? I profeſſe I want light to dive into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this work of darkneſſe, and none am I able to procure from you, but ten degrees more of obſcurity: I am not ſatisfied in your menning, when you ſpeak of the Crown, the Scepter and the Throne of Chriſt, glorious yea, and tranſcendently excellent they be; but where ſhall I find them, let me ſee: And when Scripture hath ſpoken, and reaſon hath given in its voyce, you can prove that theſe are to be found in the way of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and in no way elſe, or that they have more excellency caſt upon them by reaſon of that glorious in manifeſtation of them in this way above others: And if my Arguments (when weighed in the ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary) ſhall be found too light, and unable to) gain-ſay yours, my heart, hand, and all ſhall give place to you, and you ſhall have the right-hand of fellowſhip in procuring a bleſſed and happy union. For my own particular I have examined (as I am able) what ever Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath done, and have not met with any grounds or reaſons of this your judgement: This I find, that to the utmoſt of my endevours [human frailty excepted] he hath exalted Chriſts Kingdome, and laboured with the ſtrength of his abilities
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112937:7"/>to keep the Crown on the head of Chriſt, and to make his Scepter an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Scepter.</p>
            <p>But whereas you give us to underſtand what you have done, and do for Chriſt in exaltation of him, and him alone, yet I find you and all of yee are ſilent of your failings in the right performance of it, as if yee were already deified: I beſeech yee to examine well your inward man, and then tell me whether much of the glory of God be not eclypſed through your infirmities; how have yee ſought the honour of God and preferred it above all things, when your own honour ſteps in and robs God of his due? Is there not an eye looking too much to private advantage, deſtitute of that ſingleneſſe of heart which of right ſhould take place in thoſe that aſſume the priviledge of being Chriſt exalters? What elſe portends that daily apoſtaſie of ſo many of yee, that from gliſtering ſtars of light (as I have judged) yee are deſcended almoſt to an expiring glimmering.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The eleventh Charge againſt Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> ſtands thus: That he ſhould affirme Chriſt hath left no rule in his Word for the government of his Church.</p>
            <p>I affirme the ſame in that ſenſe by him delivered, but ſo ſpeaking, as you have laid it down, there is not to be produced any one paſſage, ſo much as looking that way: This he hath laid down as a Truth (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was nor can be diſproved), that Jeſus Chriſt in his Word, hath left a rule for the ſubſtantiall part of worſhip and diſcipline, and ſome few cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, yet left many things which belong to the well-being of a Church, (as they relate to circumſtantials, whether of time or place, &amp;c.) which are to be ordered in the ſeverall ages and ſucceſſions of the Churches of Chriſt, according to the ſtate and condition thereof then exiſting, as may beſt conduce to the glory of God, the Churches peace, and the good of the Common-wealth. But if you would have perfection in all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Church government, that is a condition fit for heaven, but not to be found on earth. For ſo long as man hath the tranſaction of divine things, and they muſt of neceſſity be conveighed thorow earthen conduit pipes, they will loſe much of their ſplendour, honour and glory, which a ſtate of perfection is only capable of.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The twelfth particular proceeds to ſentence of Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> writings, for which you ſhould have taken him for a Papiſt or Jeſuit, had not the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle borne his name.</p>
            <p>I am now to ſeek, and have loſt my ſelf in fathoming this great deep: Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> turned Papiſt, or Jeſuit, or both, and all the world ignorant of it, till <hi>John Lilburnes</hi> learning (raked out of the aſhes of ignorance) diſcovered tenents &amp; poſitions of Papiſts &amp; Jeſuits covertly conducted in M. <hi>Pryns</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that never infected any man; I beſeech you befriend my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little in this particular, and if love have induced you to make known the worlds ignorance, in not taking notice of ſo weighty a matter, and this mans errours; that you would be pleaſed to propound theſe tenents and poſitions which have begotten ſuch a ſuſpition, to the infecting the ſtrength
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112937:7"/>of your imagination, that I may be partaker with you in this knowledge, and be able to juſtifie you, and condemn him. Moreover, I will aſſure you, upon the faith of a Chriſtian, that all the abilities, the faculties of my ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall all engage themſelves in war againſt him. But on the other ſide, if you be found an accuſer of the Brethren, you muſt remember to whom that property is aſcribed: If you deny me this, I ſhall hence-forth reject your judgement as invalid as your Arguments are unfeaſable: And let me adde, that if the mouth of Wiſdome had delivered, what you conclude on, there would have been a great deale of ground to have ſearched with a criticall eye what he had done, but not to reject it, much leſſe upon ſo ſlight and groundleſſe confutation: I may, and with more truth reply by way of retortion, that had your name been wanting, your Pamphlet might have undergone the charge of Libell for ought I find contained in it; and if my ſentence may ſtand, I judge it worthy no better commendations, it being the matter and not <hi>Anonymus,</hi> that makes a Libel. Now for that peece of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you are pleaſed to beſtow on Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> as to account him worthy to be canonized for a Saint in the Popes Remembrancer: I muſt tell you I am ignorant of the crafty conveyance of this honour [your proper right] upon the head of Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> ſo ill be comming his Profeſſion; verily I ſhould have judged you, and men of your ſpirit to have been ſooner accepted of the Pope (for your madneſſe) as inſtruments to advance his kingdome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion (whoſe ſpirits hath taken poſſeſſion of many of you) before Mr. <hi>Pryn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to ſtand for Saint in his Calendar, for fighting againſt that great Babel, who hath done more to help forwards the ruine thereof [for which poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will call him bleſſed] than you, or all of yee pacht together; ſo that I do admire and am confounded in my own ſpirit at the conſideration of this ſpirit, that hath breathed forth ſo much unſavourineſſe, hard ſpeeches and groundleſſe jealouſies, which I find in ſo few leaves againſt an innocent perſon, as if hell had open'd its mouth to be delivered of its impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The thirteenth Charge lyes in this, in that he hath made <hi>Moſes</hi> more faithfull than Chriſt.</p>
            <p>My Anſwer is, that I find not any ſuch aſſertion in all his Works, if you can ſhew it me, I will beleeve you, till that time, I aſſure you, you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unacquainted with the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein it did conſiſt; which was not in making Lawes for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but in delivering thoſe Lawes God gave him; ſo Chriſt, in what he did, had not reſpect to the Leviticall Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a patterne for him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which was carnall and ready to vaniſh away, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.13. But this was ſpirituall and to endure for ever. In which Chriſt did not any thing as of himſelf, but by the Commandment of God. So that herein conſiſts the compleatneſſe of Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> faithfulneſſe in delivering what they had received in charge from God the Father, which theſe Scriptures evidence, <hi>John</hi> 7.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>John</hi> 8.26.28. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.1, 2, 5, 6. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Exodus</hi> 25.40.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:112937:8"/>
14. The fourteenth and laſt Charge, reflecting on Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> is his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular intereſts more than truth, that hath engaged him in this way he is now in.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant but there is and will be ſomething of man in every action, as long as man remaines in the ſtate of imperfection, but that ſelf-ends and private intereſts carry a greater ſtroke in his engagement, and prevailes moſt upon his judgement, reſts on your part to be proved (when you can) who have unjuſtly and unworthily charged him, have you had any experience of him in any thing, from whence you can in any way of equity draw this concluſion, or is not your own guilt charged upon his ſcore? The day of reckoning will reſolve this doubt. What though ſome of yee (and that no mean ones) not being able to diſanull his Arguments, have fallen to queſtion him about the truth of his religion, whether there be ſuch a thing in reality to be found in him ſave only the bare principles of morality, ſhall I judge him the worſe for this? No, becauſe I have found it the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den path of Heretiques to traduce their unconquered adverſary with ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when thoſe arguments they brought could not convince them; and I can judge no otherwiſe of this [though they be godly perſons that do it] them that it is that evill ſpirit riſen from the dead, the rather have I toucht at this, by reaſon of them from whom it hath proceeded, men that profeſſe perfection of Religion above others, I beſeech them to be wary of what they do, leſt apoſtaſie ſpeak them worſe than men of no religion, <hi>Let him that ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi>

            <p>Thus have I run over your Letter with what ſpeed I could, omitting many things through other imployments that ſtand in my way <hi>(viz.)</hi> Your Impudency in charging Parliaments, Synods, and Councels to be of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, your diſhonourable and undervaluing thoughts of them, your expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſcorne and contempt, your charge of the Parliament for breach of oath in enacting Tythes, the proofe of which by you is too ridiculous to be anſwered. And this done with that audaciouſneſſe, as if your folly could reply upon their wiſdome, and your knowledge ſearch the bottom of the greateſt myſteries in Church and State, that cannot pierce a ſhallow rivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. I leave them all to be anſwered by a more able pen (if they be thought worthy an anſwer) or to the deciſion of the lawfull and undoubted power of civill Magiſtracy.</p>
